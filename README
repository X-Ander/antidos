synfloodguard - Protect against SYN-flood attacks

	The program reads /proc/net/tcp periodically searching the half-opened
	connections (SYN_RECV). If there are too many such connections from
	some IP address, that address is blacklisted for some time. Blacklisting
	is done by run the 'ipset' command. You need to configure your firewall
	with a rule like:

	 # iptables -I INPUT 1 -m set --match-set <set name> src -j DROP
