synfloodguard - Protect against SYN-flood attacks

	Version: 0.11

	The program reads /proc/net/tcp periodically searching the half-opened
	connections (SYN_RECV). If there are too many such connections from
	some IP address, that address is blacklisted for some time. Blacklisting
	is done by run the 'ipset' command. You need to create the IP set and
	configure your firewall to use it. For example:

	 # ipset -N synfloodguard iphash
	 # iptables -I INPUT 1 -m set --match-set synfloodguard src -j DROP
